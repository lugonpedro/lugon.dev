    "text": "Hi, I'm Pedro ðŸ‘‹, also known as Lugon. Born in BrasÃ­lia, capital of Brazil, I had my first experience with programming in 2017, using Java at college. Since then I worked with OOP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and a little bit of Python, and still at the beggining of 2020 I finished my first grand project alone ðŸš€. And so I started to study TDD and Design Patterns, which made me feel confident and free to join the job market, since then I seek to know, study and practice new tecnologies that accrete and bring me practicality and greater performance in solving problems!"
